            			<p>I wish I had found github pages sooner.  This is so much easier than trying to host my own domain.  
            				Technically, I suppose the site isn't codesloth.net anymore, but I'm going to keep the header because I like the sloth.

            			<h2>Password Generator</h2>
            			<p>I have been getting lots of emails lately about the heartbleed vulnerability, and I feel like it's time to pay more attention to my passwords.  
            				I've been using the same set of two or three basic passwords for a few years now.
            				I know this is a bad thing, but I haven't got around to doing anything about it yet.
            				To that end, I made a simple program to generate random passwords of a specified length.  
            				Click <a href="passwordgenerator.html">here</a> to check it out.</p>

            			<h2>Cheat Sheets!</h2>
            			<p>The first set of programming cheat sheets are up.  These are intended to act as quick reference sheets on programming syntax for various languages.<br /><br />
            				When I was learning programming, I often found myself wishing for a single resource to remind me of syntax defferences between languages.  
            				These reference sheets are my solution.  They contain basic syntax for Javascript, C#, Java, Ruby, Perl, and Python.
            				More may be added in the future as needed.  Click <a href="codesheets.html">here</a> for the cheat sheets.</p>
